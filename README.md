## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit && cd conduit
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run -d ios   # or: -d android
```

## Features

### Core Features
- **Real-time Chat**: Stream responses from AI models in real-time
- **Model Selection**: Choose from available models on your server
- **Conversation Management**: Create, search, and manage chat histories
- **Markdown Rendering**: Full markdown support with syntax highlighting
- **Theme Support**: Light, Dark, and System themes

### Advanced Features
- **Voice Input**: Use speech-to-text for hands-free interaction
- **File Uploads**: Support for images and documents (RAG)
- **Multi-modal Support**: Work with vision models
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials stored securely using platform keychains
- **Folder Management**: Organize conversations into folders; create, rename, move, and delete
 - **Tools (Function Calling)**: Invoke server-side tools exposed by Open‑WebUI, with result rendering

### Authentication
Conduit supports multiple authentication flows when connecting to your Open‑WebUI:
- **Username + Password**: Sign in directly against servers that expose a login endpoint. Credentials are stored securely using platform keychains.
- **SSO / OAuth** (iOS & Android): Authenticate via your server's configured OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, OIDC, etc.) using an in-app WebView. The token is automatically captured after the OAuth flow completes.
- **Reverse Proxy Support** (iOS & Android): Seamlessly connect to Open WebUI instances behind authentication proxies like oauth2-proxy, Authelia, Authentik, Pangolin, Cloudflare Tunnel, etc. Conduit automatically detects when proxy authentication is required and guides you through the login flow—no endpoint allowlisting or server-side configuration needed. Proxy session cookies are captured from the native cookie store and included in all subsequent API requests.
- **LDAP**: Sign in using LDAP credentials if enabled on your server.
- **JWT Token**: Paste a server‑issued JWT token for manual token-based auth.
- **Custom Headers**: Add headers during login (e.g., `X-API-Key`, `Authorization`, `X-Org`) that Conduit will include on all HTTP/WebSocket requests.

The authentication page dynamically displays available options based on your server's configuration.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK 3.0.0 or higher
- Android 6.0 (API 23) or higher
- iOS 12.0 or higher
- A running Open-WebUI instance

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conduit.git
cd conduit
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Generate code:
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
# For iOS
flutter run -d ios

# For Android
flutter run -d android
```

## Building for Release

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or for App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

## Configuration

### Android
The app requires the following permissions:
- Internet access
- Microphone (for voice input)
- Camera (for taking photos)
- Storage (for file selection)

### iOS
The app will request permissions for:
- Microphone access (voice input)
- Speech recognition
- Camera access
- Photo library access

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with:
- **Riverpod** for state management
- **Dio** for HTTP networking
- **WebSocket** for real-time streaming
- **Flutter Secure Storage** for credential management

## Troubleshooting

- iOS: ensure recent Xcode, run `cd ios && pod install`, set signing team in Xcode if building on device.
- Android: minSdk 23+, ensure correct Java and Gradle; if builds fail, try `flutter clean`.
- Codegen conflicts: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.

### Streaming Issues

If you experience problems with real-time streaming or chat updates, ensure websocket support is enabled on your Open-WebUI server. See the [Websocket Support documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/tutorials/integrations/redis/#websocket-configuration) for configuration details. Required environment variables include `ENABLE_WEBSOCKET_SUPPORT="true"`.

## Security & Privacy

- Credentials are stored using platform secure storage (Keychain/Keystore).
- No analytics or telemetry are collected.
- Network calls are only made to your configured Open‑WebUI server.
